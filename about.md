# About Me

I'm Keith, a fence estimator at **Complete Custom Fence** in Central Florida. I've spent 35+ years in the construction industry and I'm now focused on building internal tools to make the estimating process faster and more accurate.

## What I'm Doing Here

This site is where I share the tools I'm building, the problems I'm solving, and what I'm learning along the way. Most of my projects are focused on:

- **Fence estimating workflows** — calculators, templates, and automation
- **Construction tech** — practical tools for small crews and contractors
- **Learning in public** — documenting the build process as I go
