# about Me

I'm ContractorKeith - I've been in construction as an electrician, plumber, GC, home builder, estimator, PM, owner, and anythinbg else you can think of, for 37yrs. 

I have spent the last couple of years trying to learn code, and I have broken more than I ever did building buildings...

I will add more as I think of it..
